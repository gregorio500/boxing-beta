<p style="color":"red">This is a demo for simulating boxing technique.</p>

<h2>For who?</h2>
<p align="justify">The main goal of this app is helping fighters to prepare to fight. This demo only focusing on basic boxing techniques. In the commercial version I am going to add commands from MMA and kickboxing. <br>
 The app helps you to be prepared to fight especially when you have access to the videos fights of your next opponent. <br>
Before you set the program and start shadow boxing by imaging your real opponent focus on following things to build a scheme for the given opponent:</p> <br>
<ul>
<li>fighting rhythm of your opponent (frequency of the initiating single punch, combos, specific rhythm of footwork  </li>
<li>what kind of single punch or combos your opponent initiating and a situation under it happens</li>
<li>just do a simple statistic from your opponent fights, including all actions, and then, set the details on the timeline in this app. </li>
</ul> 

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<h2>Who is a creator?</h2>
<p align="justify">My big passion is MMA and any other full-contact combat sport. I’ve been training martial arts since childhood. I was a professional fighter in MMA and the amateur fighter in brazilian ju-jitsu. My goal is to create new tools to help fight athletes to prepare to fight. Each fight should be predictable as much as possible, that's why I've created that demo<br>
